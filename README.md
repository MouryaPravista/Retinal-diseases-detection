# 🧠 Retinal Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting retinal diseases from fundus images through image classification techniques. It aims to support early diagnosis by identifying conditions such as **Diabetic Retinopathy**, **Glaucoma**, **Age-related Macular Degeneration**, and **Hypertensive Retinopathy**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Developed and tested in **Google Colab**
- Built a custom image classification model using convolutional neural networks
- Provides classification output and visual results on sample data
- Deployment-ready notebook for demonstration or integration purposes
